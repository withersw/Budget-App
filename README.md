# Overview
This app is to make budgeting easier and more mobile. I created it to further my learning and skills in mobile development and in using the Java language. When opened the app will direct the user to a login page where the user will input their user name and password. If correct the user will be dreicted to the main page of the app where they can enter current income or expense as well as expenses and income they anticipate. The user's input is then added to a display where they can see it all in order.
